# Cyber Security Internship – Task 11

## 📌 Task Title
Phishing Attack Simulation & Detection

## 🛠 Tools & Environment
- Kali Linux
- Text Editor (nano / gedit)
- Web Browser (Firefox)
- Manual phishing templates (offline simulation)

## 🎯 Objective
To understand phishing attacks as a social engineering threat by simulating phishing techniques in a controlled environment and learning how to detect and prevent such attacks.

## 📚 Task Overview
This task focuses on performing an **ethical phishing simulation** without targeting real users or systems.  
A fake phishing email template and a simulated login landing page were created locally to demonstrate how phishing attacks work, identify red flags, and study detection and prevention techniques.

All activities were performed strictly for educational purposes.

## 🧪 Simulation Environment
- Operating System: Kali Linux
- Simulation Type: Manual & Offline
- Target: No real users or email systems
- Compliance: Ethical and legal standards followed

## 🔍 Key Learnings
- Understanding phishing and social engineering techniques
- Recognizing psychological manipulation used in phishing
- Identifying phishing indicators and red flags
- Learning phishing detection methods
- Applying prevention and mitigation strategies

## 🛡 Security Impact
Phishing attacks can bypass technical security controls by exploiting human behavior.  
Improving user awareness, combined with technical defenses such as email filtering and multi-factor authentication, is critical to preventing phishing incidents.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This task was performed in a controlled lab environment for educational purposes only.  
No real phishing emails were sent, no real domains were used, and no personal data was collected.
